# Test Project Readme

This website is accessible here: https://vinpekauto.vercel.app/

# Description
This test project is a Django-based website featuring a PostgreSQL database and Django ORM for data management. The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and Crispy for styling. Django Rest Framework (DRF) is used for creating secure APIs for frontend-backend communication. The project follows Django best practices for a structured codebase.

# Features

Django: Python web framework for rapid development.

Django ORM: Database interaction using Python objects.

Django Rest Framework (DRF): Toolkit for building Web APIs with serialization.

PostgreSQL: Reliable and performant relational database management system, the PostgreSQL database is hosted on Vercel.

Bootstrap: Frontend framework for responsive design.

Crispy Forms: Django application for rendering forms with Bootstrap styles.

Docker: The website, including both the backend and frontend, works fine with this Docker setup. However, I don't host it using Docker because it isn't free. Instead, I've hosted it for free on Vercel without Docker (https://vinpekauto.vercel.app/). Nonetheless, the dockerization process was successful, so you can immediately try it out using Docker locally if you wish. Please note that, in this case you'll need to provide at least your PostgreSQL host and password details inside the env.py file. (The database I use also contains private information, so I can't include them in this public repository.)
